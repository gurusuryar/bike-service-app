# Bike Service (Frontend)

## Overview

This is the frontend of the Bike Service application, built using React as part of a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a user interface for interacting with the bike service, including user registration, login, service booking, and viewing booking details. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform these operations.

### Features

**User Management**: There are two types of users â€“ owners and customers.

  - **Bike Station Owners**:
    - Create, edit, and delete all their services and details.
    - View a list of all bookings (pending, ready for delivery, and completed).
    - View details of each booking.
    - Mark a booking as ready for delivery.
    - Mark a booking as completed.
    - Receive an email whenever a booking is made.

  - **Customers**:
    - Register for an account with an email address and mobile number.
    - Book a service for a particular date.
    - See the status of their booking.
    - View all previous bookings.
    - Receive an email as soon as their booking is ready for delivery.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Access to the backend server's API URL.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>

```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `client` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Start the Development Server
Start the development server to run the application locally:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a build directory containing the optimized production build of the application.

## Deployment
You can deploy the contents of the build directory to your preferred hosting service. Here are general steps to deploy to popular services:

### 1. Deploy to Heroku
Create a Heroku application:
```bash
heroku create <FRONTEND_APP_NAME>
```
Deploy to Heroku:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy frontend"
git push heroku master

```



### 2. Deploy to Netlify
