# Bike Service (Backend)

## Overview

This is the backend of the Bike Service application, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as part of a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides the API for interacting with the bike service application, including user management, service management, and booking operations.

### Features

- **User Management**: There are two types of users â€“ owners and customers.

  - **Bike Station Owners**:
    - Create, edit, and delete all their services and details.
    - View a list of all bookings (pending, ready for delivery, and completed).
    - View details of each booking.
    - Mark a booking as ready for delivery.
    - Mark a booking as completed.
    - Receive an email whenever a booking is made.

  - **Customers**:
    - Register for an account with an email address and mobile number.
    - Book a service for a particular date.
    - See the status of their booking.
    - View all previous bookings.
    - Receive an email as soon as their booking is ready for delivery.
